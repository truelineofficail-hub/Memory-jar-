MEMORY JAR - offline installable web app
========================================
Files
  index.html      app shell
  style.css       styles
  app.js          app logic + service-worker registration
  sw.js           service worker (caches everything, works fully offline)
  manifest.json   web app manifest (install to home screen)
  icons/          app icons (any + maskable, apple-touch, favicon, svg)

Deploy (GitHub Pages)
  1. Unzip and upload ALL files to the root of a GitHub repo (keep the icons folder).
  2. Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from a branch -> main -> / (root).
  3. Open https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/ once with internet.
     After that it works with no connection.
  Install: Android Chrome -> menu -> "Install app"; iPhone Safari -> Share -> "Add to Home Screen".

Local test (service workers need http, not file://)
  python3 -m http.server 8000     then open http://localhost:8000

Your data
  Memories and photos are saved only in this browser on this device (IndexedDB).
  Clearing the site's data removes them. There is no account and no server.

Updating: change VERSION at the top of sw.js so phones fetch the new files.
Fonts: the app uses your device's built-in serif and sans fonts, so nothing is downloaded.
